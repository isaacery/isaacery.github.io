I am cofounder of [OMGrab](https://www.omgrab.com), where we're building smartglasses and data infrastructure to collect massive scale robot training data. Our work focuses on closing the training data gap between robotics and language by making it easier to collect human POV demonstrations. We make smartglasses containing robotics grade cameras, and build data infrastructure for large model training.

I spent several years working on challenging real-time control tasks at [Agentic](https://www.agentic.ai/) (now part of Epic Games), where we trained small machine learning models to play video games on-device in real time. While at Agentic I also co-authored [Enact](https://github.com/agentic-ai/enact), a Python library for tracking the output of generative software and agents.

Before joining Agentic I did machine learning research at [the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/research/ianc/) at the University of Edinburgh advised by [Sohan Seth](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/sohan-seth). There I published two first author papers (see below) applying deep learning to population mapping for UNICEF.
